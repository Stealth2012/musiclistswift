# Music List
Sample app originally written for iOS 9 and then recreated using SwiftUI for iOS 13. Lists songs from local database and shows some details (lorem ipsum placeholder).
This app uses **Core Data** to access data from prepared SQLite database. Album covers are also embedded into the project.
